                    1. Copper sprays can be used for control of leaf spot bacteria, but they may not be effective when used alone continuously. Indeed, continuous copper sprays may lead to the development of resistant strains of leaf spot bacteria and thus decrease the effectiveness of copper sprays.

                    2. Products containing microorganisms can be used to enhance plant growth and reduce the negative effects of diseases. These products may contain plant-growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) or biological agents

                    1. Gray leaf spot overwinters on corn residue and can be especially problematic in corn planted behind corn.  The fungus does not grow well on non-host residues.  Rotating away from corn may help reduce local levels of inoculum and reduce Gray leaf spot severity in the following corn crop. 

                    2. It is essential that resistant varieties be used in fields with a history of Gray leaf spot

                    3. There are numerous fungicides available for control of Gray leaf spot.  However, there is no guarantee that fungicide applications will result in economic returns, especially if they are applied to highly resistant hybrids in fields with little disease.  For this reason it is important to scout fields for symptoms of Gray leaf spot and apply fungicides only when they are needed. 

                    4.  Gray leaf spot severity is unpredictable and multiple factors should be considered when making the decision to use fungicides to control Gray leaf spot.

                    1. choose corn varieties or hybrids that are resistant or at least have moderate resistance to corn leaf blight.

                    2. When you grow corn, make sure it does not stay wet for long periods of time

                    3. The fungus that causes this infection needs between six and 18 hours of leaf wetness to develop. Plant corn with enough space for airflow and water in the morning so leaves can dry throughout the day.

                    4. Tilling the corn into the soil is one strategy, but with a small garden it may make more sense to just remove and destroy the affected plants

                    3. Late-planted corn is more likely to have higher levels of infection since it will likely have young, more susceptible leaves during the time when spores first arrive from overwintering locations.

                    1. Treatment of early blight includes prevention by planting potato varieties that are resistant to the disease; late maturing are more resistant than early maturing varietie.\n

                    2. Avoid overhead irrigation and allow for sufficient aeration between plants to allow the foliage to dry as quickly as possible.\n

                    3. Keep the potato plants healthy and stress free by providing adequate nutrition and sufficient irrigation, especially later in the growing season after flowering when plants are most susceptible to the disease.\n

                    4. For best control, apply copper-based fungicides early, two weeks before disease normally appears or when weather forecasts predict a long period of wet weather.\n

                    1. Eliminate potato cull piles and all other sources of living tubers and eliminate volunteer potatoes from last season.

                    2. Be aware of the relative susceptibility to late blight of the potato varieties that you are planting. Russet Burbank and Snowden are moderately susceptible; Atlantic, Monona, Norchip, Red Norland, Russet Norkotah, and Yukon Gold are very susceptible.

                    3. Plant certified seed and be aware of the late blight situation in the field from which it was harvested. Check the "North American Certified Seed Potato Health Certificate" provided for each lot.

                    4. Minimize handling of seed tubers; if seed is cut, immediately treat with a mancozeb-containing fungicide.

                    5. Hill potatoes to ensure that young tubers are adequately covered by soil.

                    1. Use this recipe to make your own solution—mix one tablespoon of baking soda with a teaspoon of dormant oil and one teaspoon of insecticidal or liquid soap (not detergent) to a gallon of water. Spray on plants every one to two weeks.

                    2. Baking Soda (sodium bicarbonate) -This is possibly the best known of the home-made, organic solutions for powdery mildew. Although studies indicate that baking soda alone is not all that effective, when combined with horticultural grade or dormant oil and liquid soap, efficacy is very good if applied in the early stages or before an outbreak occurs.

                    3. Potassium bicarbonate– Similar to baking soda, this has the unique advantage of actually eliminating powdery mildew once it’s there. Potassium bicarbonate is a contact fungicide which kills the powdery mildew spores quickly. In addition, it’s approved for use in organic growing.

                    1. Tomato plants are used to growing in dry climates, so they are unusually sensitive to water on their leaves, which makes them more prone to fungal infections than many other crops.

                    2. Take every precaution you can to minimize the amount of moisture on your tomato plants. Try to avoid working with or around your plants in wet weather.

                    3. When you remove the weeds and volunteer plants, make sure you destroy them – do not place on your compost pile.

                    4. Fertilize properly to maintain vigorous plant growth. Particularly, do not over-fertilize with potassium and maintain adequate levels of both nitrogen and phosphorus.

                    2. Consider organic fungicide options. Fungicides containing either copper or potassium bicarbonate will help prevent the spreading of the disease. Begin spraying as soon as the first symptoms appear and follow the label directions for continued management.
                    
                    3. Consider chemical fungicides. While chemical options are not ideal, they may be the only option for controlling advanced infections. One of the least toxic and most effective is chlorothalonil (sold under the names Fungonil and Daconil).
                    
                    4. Start with a clean garden. Dispose of all affected plants. The fungus can over-winter on the debris of diseased plants. It's important to dispose of all the affected plants far away from the garden and the compost pile. Keep in mind that it may have spread to your potatoes and eggplants, too.

                    1. There are no cures for viral diseases such as mosaic once a plant is infected. As a result, every effort should be made to prevent the disease from entering your garden.

                    2. Tomato mosaic virus of tomatoes can exist in the soil or plant debris for up to two years, and can be spread just by touch – a gardener who touches or even brushes up against an infected plant can carry the infection for the rest of the day.  You should wash your hands with soap and disinfect tools after handling tomato plants to keep the disease from spreading.

                    3. Treating mosaic virus is difficult and there are no chemical controls like there are for fungal diseases, although some varieties of tomato are resistant to the disease, and seeds can be bought that are certified disease free.
